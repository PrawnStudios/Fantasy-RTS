Create function in GameSystems called Log()

whenever an action is taken, pass the action as a string to the log function. 

THe log function will then add the string and game time as a new line ina a text document.
after the game is done convert from a .ini to a custom file type eg .RTSReplay.

To watch the replays load a scene that will convert the file back to a .txt and read it line by line. extecution the action at the game time stroed with it. 

Example:

[Started Training]
Time = 0:30
Unit = Archers
Barracks = Barracks Name Here
Slot = 1

[Finished Training]
Time = 1:45
Unit = Archers
Barracks = Barracks Name Here
Slot = 1

[Unit Moved]
Unit Name = Archers(1)

Current Position.x = 100
Current Position.y = 0
Current Position.z = 35

New Position.x = 500
New Position.y = 25
New Position.z = 40
